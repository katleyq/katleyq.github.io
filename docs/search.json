    "text": "Scientists have projected that the human population will grow to 9.7 billion people by 2050 (Godfray et al. 2010). As the global population grows, global food demand continues to grow at the same rate. Agricultural expansion has been crucial to meeting this food demand; however, the impacts of agricultural intensification has been detrimental to our ecosystem (Tilman et al. 2011). Land clearing, fertilizer use, and greenhouse gas emissions via agricultural practices have contributed to species habitat loss, global warming, and the overconsumption and pollution of our water sources. It is imperative that we find new, sustainable ways to meet the food demand of a growing global population to mitigate disastrous downstream effects of current agricultural practices.\nMarine aquaculture has the potential to be an important sustainable food source to meet global food demands, while limiting our carbon footprint and saving water (Gentry et al. 2017). As a cool example of the benefits of marine aquaculture, scientists are developing ways to farm seaweed to use as a food source for humans, a potential biofuel for energy generation, and an ingredient for cosmetic products (Kübler, Dudgeon, and Bush 2021) (Kraan 2010) (Couteau and Coiffard 2016). In addition to the versatile potential of seaweed, some species of seaweed can grow 1 foot per day under ideal conditions (Reed, Rassweiler, and Arkema 2008). That’s so cool to me! One thing you should know about me is that I LOVE seaweed. There are so many benefits to seaweed aquaculture, and perhaps one of the most advantageous aspects is that you don’t need to water seaweed. I could go on about seaweed for days, but the important takeaway here is that marine aquaculture has the potential to be an important path forward in finding sustainable ways to feed a growing population.\nIn order to build out the marine aquaculture industry, it is important to find suitable locations for the marine species that we plan to farm. The overarching goal of this project is to fill this need and create a reproducible workflow for identifying optimal locations for aquaculture."

    "text": "Kat Le is a Master of Environmental Data Science student, who is interested in applying advanced technology to solving environmental problems and teaching others how to do the same. As an undergraduate at the University of California Santa Barbara, they expanded their knowledge of environmental systems through obtaining a bachelor’s degree in Biological Sciences. Their curiosity and appetite for learning led them to participate in multiple research projects, where they got to deepen their understanding of the biological, chemical, and physical drivers of kelp forest ecosystems. After college, they served as the lead lab technician for a Department of Energy research project studying the potential of giant kelp as a biofuel. Through their many years of research experience, they found their passion for learning new technology to analyze environmental data. As a data fellow for the Environmental Data Initiative, they moved to a remote biological field station in Pennsylvania, where they designed and built workflows for managing the station’s sensor data. \nIn addition to being a student now, they have been working as a staff member at Bren, where they have been strengthening their technical knowledge by working in research and education information technology. They have been excited to help students and researchers utilize and troubleshoot technology for their coursework and research projects. Promoting equal access to education is central to Kat’s mission, and they hope to use their technical skill-set and knowledge about environmental systems to foster an inclusive learning space for the newest generation of environmental scientists."
