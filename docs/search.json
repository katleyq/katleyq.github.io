Blooms can last for a few days to a few weeks, and sometimes, they can persist for months(Sellner, Doucette, and Kirkpatrick 2003). Algal blooms can be beneficial for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, but the long-term impact of these blooms can be far more detrimental for aquatic ecosystems(Grattan, Holobaugh, and Morris 2016). These photosynthetic organisms can release neurotoxins that are harmful for most living organisms, and they can eventually create oxygen dead zones by being a source of nutrients for microbes (Misra, Chandra, and Raghavendra 2011).\nThis project is motivated by my time living and working in Pennsylvania. In the summer of 2019, I saw my first algal bloom occur in Lake Arrowhead, PA (pictured below). I was curious because it looked like someone had poured paint into the lake. I learned from local residents that these blooms are actually phytoplankton and that they have been seeing these blooms happen more frequently in lakes in the Poconos. In their experience, these blooms last a few days and often times, it will cause dead fish to float to the surface. This made me curious about what factors influence the occurrence of these algal blooms.\n\n\n\nLake Arrowhead, PA. July 2019."

With advancements in technology, humans are living longer, and the population is growing at an exponential rate. In addition, our planet’s climate is changing due to the atmosphere is being loaded with greenhouse gases. One outcome of this phenomenon is that we need to meet the food demands of a growing population and we need to do it while limiting our carbon footprint.\nMarine aquaculture has the potential to be an important sustainable food source to meet food demands, while limiting our carbon footprint. To build out the marine aquaculture industry, it is important to_"
